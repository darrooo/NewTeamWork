<h1>About TeamWork</h1>
<!-- <p>Detta 채r en plattform som har allt allrahelst just nu n채r den 채r super f채rdig osv</p> -->
<p>The idea of Teamwork came up as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which forced many employees basically from one day to another to create a new way of working from home. During the year of pandemic and the restriction of social interaction that comes with it, many have been in search of new ways to stay updated on friends and colleagues. We wanted to offer a simple application that can be used simultaneously to other work-related tasks performed on a computer from home. This led to the conclusion that a phone application wasn't an ideal solution for working at home since the phone screen is too small and we assumed that the clients would want only one device to focus on. Therefor we decided to make TeamWork a web-based application.</p>
